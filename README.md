This is a fork of [DualSenseY-v2](https://github.com/WujekFoliarz/DualSenseY-v2) focused on battery indicators.

# Changelist:
- added battery indication through player leds. The leds will show up in the following way:

```
First led from the left - when battery > 5%
second - when battery > 20%
third - when battery > 40%
fourth - when battery > 60%
fifth - when battery > 80%
```

Functionality is useful for games which actively turns off RGB leds (like Tekken 8). The feature is visible only when player led is disabled.

- removed functionality of changing state of the controller only when something changed on our part, because other applications can change the state of the controllers's indicators as well.

- fixed a bug in which the same controller would be considered as two separate controllers if connected with both bluetooth and usb.

# TODO:
- [ ] low battery windows notification (registry keys will be needed)
- [ ] change tray icon to a battery state of the selected controller
- [x] add possibility to disable RGB LED modifier (currently it always changes to pitch black). Currently it makes the leds flicker when a game tries to switch to its own color.

I will make a release when above changes will be done.

# Is this related to DSX?
 - No, it's a free alternative for those who need it and a hobby project.

# How do I activate UDP?
 - All you need to do is run a game with dualsense mod installed, it will turn to active as soon as it receives data (If the mod asks for a port, use 6969)

# Problems:
 - I get a pop-up that says ViGEmBus is not installed! -> https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/download/v1.22.0/ViGEmBus_1.22.0_x64_x86_arm64.exe
 - Controller emulation is wonky? Install .NET 8.0 -> https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x86&rid=win-x86&os=win10&apphost_version=8.0.6
 - Double input in-game? Install HidHide driver and run app as admin -> https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide/releases/download/v1.5.230.0/HidHide_1.5.230_x64.exe
 - The app renders a black screen on my laptop! -> Run the application with your dedicated GPU instead of iGPU
